# Legacy project - polca!
This is a reconstruction of the polca! project from edave and sofias.

It is not supposed to be used for anything, it is mostly here for nostalgic reasons.

polca! is a **pol**ish notation **ca**lculator written in PHP. Right now it supports
basic operators. (\+ \- \* \/ %)

The project already had more advanced features like functions stored in cookies,
help documents and working forward notation support but those files have apparently
been lost to the abyss.
